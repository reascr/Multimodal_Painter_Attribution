[PAINTER]'s Venus has nothing to do with Giorgione's idealised image of female beauty, it is normally interpreted as an allegory of marital love.

This painting's subject is the reconciliation between the two apostles who had been in disagreement, a fact shown by the joining of the hands, that intertwine without touching.The intensive colours of the cloaks, whose energy underlines the Baroque contrasts of light and shade, did not prevent [PAINTER] from creating a balanced composition. The delicate painting of the hands and portrait-like faces concentrate the attention on the humanity of Peter and Paul (t","GRECO, El"

It tells how Vulcan, in a clumsy attempt to ravish Minerva, accidentally let his semen spill over the ground, and Mother Earth, thus fertilized, gave birth to Erichthonius. Minerva shut the infant in a basket, which she entrusted to the three daughters of Cecrops, king of Attica, forbidding them to open it.
