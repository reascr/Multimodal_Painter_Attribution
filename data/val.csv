He took the small likeness he had painted dal vivo (from life) as his model, and adapted it to suit the occasion: the dead man's features are made flatteringly younger, the bust enlarged to the size of a pedestal, and the inscription of Sansovino's name is added. The overall result was a portrait very much in the nature of a memorial",TINTORETTO

The saint's soul has materialized in this painting top right, where St Mark is shown as a flying figure coming in haste to rescue a Saracen who has called on him in his hour of need, and conveying him to a lifeboat as a reward for his conversion. The symbol of the power of God's own aid symmetrically balances the figure of the saint, manifesting itself as a mysterious cloud in human form. ",TINTORETTO
